Here I will document work done in fulfillment of the project _NumFocus & SciML, PDEs on Graphs_.

# Week of May 14
  1. Forked `MethodOfLines.jl` to implement examples
  2. Updated forked `FEniCS.jl` to implement examples
  3. Worked through `MethodOfLines.jl` tutorials to gain understanding
     a. MoL feels a little unwieldy, but it is compared to nothing. An apples-to-apples comparison would need to write the methods from scratch, and then deploy the DifferentialEquations interface to solve them...This is likely a good comparison to do and document, first as a goal to reduce any performance differences, and second to quantify (in SLOC) the difference in developer effort. 

# May 5
  * Set up this page
  * Reached out to Chris and Alex
  * Identified [organizational expectations](https://github.com/numfocus/gsoc/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING-students.md)
  * Identified Goals for the coming week:
    * Implement examples using `MethodOfLines.jl`, paying particular attention to
      * handling of boundary conditions
      * conversion from symbolic to executable
      * systems of equations
    * Diagram necessary work to complete [staggered grid issue](https://github.com/SciML/MethodOfLines.jl/issues/255)
    * Detail finite volume examples to implement with `FEniCS.jl`
