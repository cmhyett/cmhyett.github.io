Here I will document work done in fulfillment of the project _NumFocus & SciML, PDEs on Graphs_.

# May 5
  * Set up this page
  * Reached out to Chris and Alex
  * Identified [organizational expectations](https://github.com/numfocus/gsoc/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING-students.md)
  * Identified Goals for the coming week:
    * Implement examples using `MethodOfLines.jl`, paying particular attention to
      * handling of boundary conditions
      * conversion from symbolic to executable
      * systems of equations
    * Diagram necessary work to complete [staggered grid issue](https://github.com/SciML/MethodOfLines.jl/issues/255)
    * Detail finite volume examples to implement with `FEniCS.jl`
